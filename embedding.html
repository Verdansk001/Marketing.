<h4>How I lost everything because of my igorance of how to register CAC for my business.</h4>
           <p> During my NYSC, I received a call from my elder sister, Ifeoma, telling me that my dad had some serious eye issues that would make him go blind and that he needed to undergo eye surgery quickly to prevent him from going.</p>
           <p>She also told me, crying bitterly, that this surgery was going to cost about <b>1.7 milliom Naira</b> to be done in an eye specialist hospital in Akwa Ibom State, Nigeria</p>
           <p>On hearing this, I wa devastated, thinking about how I, my mom, or my siblings could raise 1.7 million naira in less than a month.</p>
           <p>This made me almost have a car accident while crossing the road because of how consumed I was with my thoughts. After sharing this situation with a friend of mine, Tony, he was so touched and concerned, and then he told me about a supply job he got recently at Adolak Hotel, a 4-star hotel in Osogbo, Osun State, Nigeria, that was all about supplying all the toiletries for the hotel, and if I could pull that through, I could make almost a million in profit to assist me to pay for my dad's surgery.</p>
           <p>I was so excited about this, and Tony arranged for me to meet with the CEO of the hotel 3 days after we spoke. When I met with the CEO of Adolak hotel, we had a great conversation, and I was able to convince him that I could do that job, which he was pleased about. </p>
           <p>Then finally, He told me that he would love to give me the job, but his hotel doesn't like dealing with individuals for contracts like this and instead prefers a well-registered business with CAC. So he asked me if I had a registered business, and because I didn't want to lose the contract that would help me with my dad's surgery, I had to say yes. Then this happened.</p>      
           <p>He gave me the contract, but I had to present a quotation with a registered business name because it is a business account on which they will be making the contract payment. But then I never had a business name, so I went to my uncle, who runs a consulting company, to assist me with his business name. And then we had an agreement that when the money is paid, he will transfer it into my own account, and then I will pay him his commission.</p>
            <p>But I never knew that using someone else's business name for a contract like this would be one of the most stupid moves I would ever make in life. To cut a long story short, the money was paid, but my uncle refused to transfer it to me as agreed, saying that because it was his business, I couldn't pay him, but he would pay me after I finished executing the contract.</p>
            <p>I was so shocked and almost gave up on hearing this from someone who I call my uncle, but just had to carry on with the deal not to disappoint the hotel CEO, because he gave me the deal based on trust.
